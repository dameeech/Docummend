Plaintiff, by his attorneys, Antin, Ehrlich & Epstein, LLP.,
respectfully sets forth and alleges, upon information and belief, as and
for their Verified Bill of Particulars in response to the demand of the
Defendant, GORDON FREEDMAN, M.D., herein as follows:

1.  The negligent acts occurred continuously from on or about September
    2017 until approximately February 20, 2018. Plaintiff reserves the
    right to supplement this response after receipt of defendant’s
    complete chart and upon completion of defendants’ depositions.

2.  The negligent acts occurred at 1540 York Avenue, New York, New York

    wean/taper the plaintiff off from opioid pain medications/controlled
    substances; Defendant, GORDON FREEDMAN, M.D., wrote prescriptions
    for opioid based medication plaintiff in excess of what was
    medically necessary; Defendant, GORDON FREEDMAN, M.D., wrote
    prescriptions for opioid based medication plaintiff in excess of
    what was legally permissible; in failing to appreciate plaintiff’s

    treat the plaintiff’s conditions of opioid addiction; in
    misdiagnosing the plaintiff plaintiff’s underlying condition as
    requiring copious amounts of opioid medication; in failing to

10. (a) – (c) Plaintiff objects as this demand is palpably improper,
    evidentiary in nature, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and outside the
    scope of a bill of particulars. Without waiving the objection,
    please see plaintiff’s response to combined demands.

11. (a-e) Not applicable; plaintiff is not making a claim for lost

    Center, 184 A.D.2d 65, 75-76 [2d Dept 1992]; see also, Patterson v.

    Paul, 250 AD2d 806, [2d Dept 1998].)

17. Plaintiff objects as this demand is palpably improper, evidentiary
    in nature, overbroad, unduly burdensome, and outside the scope of a
    bill of particulars. Without waiving the objection, the defendants
    are jointly and severally liable pursuant to the exceptions set
